    <h2> - ACTIVITY 1 - </h2>
    <P> IOT applications allows us to exchange information between various devices throughout the internet some common examples are apple watches , sensors in smart homes and many more. Some of the main features which are expected through IOT application is real time connectivity and Security of the data.

    <h2> - ACTIVITY 2 - </h2>
    <P> Smart means having a sort of intelligence which can interact with the surrounding in an autonomous manner some examples are like smart home system as its sensors gathers all the data and then act accordingly in different scenarios. Some of the main features needed for smart building is sense, think and act which makes things autonomous.
